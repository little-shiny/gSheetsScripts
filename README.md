# Google Sheets Scripts (My own)

This project is a collection of my personal functions made for my personal Google Sheets Spreadsheets.

I know coding is not perfect but I started recently and, as I said, these personal scripts I wanted to share in case someone find them useful.

## Scripts included 

### Timestamps on a single cell

  * Timestamp Changes in a Spreadsheet
  	> [!NOTE]
	> Only works to show timestamp when ANY cell is edited in the whole spreadshet
  * Timestamp changes in custom sheets	
  	> [!NOTE]
	> This one is the same as the previous but only sets a timestamp when changes are made in a specified sheet. This is useful for bigger spreadsheets with multiple tabs, setting the sheet to be tracked and ignoring the rest of the spreadsheet.
